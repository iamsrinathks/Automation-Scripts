you know what they say time is money. in today's markets, the price of a stock that you see on yourncomputer might not be the price that you end up trading at, since by the time your request reaches the xechange the price might have changed. tehrefore the quicket your can get your order to exchange better the change that you will trade at your expected price.


Picture a peer to peer computer netwrok of n nodes, that's supported to route your request from your computer to a computer where the trade is acutally registered. Lets assume all the network is not optimized yet, so its your task to implement an algorithm that computes the shortest ath from the source at index 1(your computer) to the destination at index n


example


for n= 4

network = [[1,4,200],
          [[1,2,5],
          [[1,3,10],
          [[2,3,4],
          [[2,4,150],
          [[3,4,100]]

the output shouild be

solution(n, network) = 109


the shortes path is 1 -> 2 -> 3-> 4
