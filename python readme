# Delete Pods in Multiple Kubernetes Namespaces

This Python script allows you to delete pods in multiple Kubernetes namespaces, excluding the ones you specify in the `excluded_namespaces` list. It's a handy tool for performing maintenance or cleanup tasks in a Kubernetes cluster with fine-grained control over which namespaces to exclude.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- `kubectl` configured and installed on your machine. You should have the necessary permissions to delete pods in the specified namespaces.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the script (`delete_pods.py`) in a text editor.

3. Modify the `excluded_namespaces` list at the beginning of the script to specify the namespaces you want to exclude from pod deletion.

```python
# Set the namespaces you want to exclude
excluded_namespaces = ["kube-system", "default"]
```

4. Save your changes.

5. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

6. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python delete_pods.py
```

7. The script will delete all pods in the namespaces that are not in the `excluded_namespaces` list.

**Caution**: Make sure you understand the implications of deleting pods in your namespaces. This action cannot be undone.

## Customization

You can customize this script to fit your specific needs:

- Add additional error handling or logging to improve script robustness.
- Integrate the script into your automation, CI/CD pipelines, or Kubernetes operations.
- Extend the script to include more complex operations or conditions.
