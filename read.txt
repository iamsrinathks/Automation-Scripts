Here's a README for the script that lists resources in Kubernetes namespaces while excluding specific namespaces:

# Kubernetes Resource Listing Script

This Python script simplifies the process of listing resources in Kubernetes namespaces. It allows you to exclude specific namespaces and lists resources such as Pods, Services, and Deployments in eligible namespaces.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` configured
- `kubernetes` Python client library (`pip install kubernetes`)

## Installation

1. Install the required Python library if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install kubernetes
   ```

2. Configure your `kubectl` to ensure the script has access to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context your-kube-context
   ```

## Usage

1. Customize the script:

   - Modify the `excluded_namespaces` list to specify namespaces you want to exclude from resource listing.
   - You can add more resource types to the `list_resources_in_namespace` function as needed.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python list_resources_in_namespaces.py
   ```

The script will perform the following tasks:

- Iterate through all namespaces.
- For eligible namespaces (excluding those listed in `excluded_namespaces`), it will list resources including Pods, Services, Deployments, and any other resource types you've added.

After running the script, you can review the resources in the eligible namespaces to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's configuration and status.

## Example

```bash
python list_resources_in_namespaces.py
```

## Note

- This script is read-only and does not perform any updates or deletions of resources in the cluster.

## Acknowledgments

- This script streamlines the process of resource discovery in Kubernetes namespaces, making it easier to understand the cluster's structure and contents.

You can use this README as documentation for the script and customize it further to match your specific environment and requirements.
