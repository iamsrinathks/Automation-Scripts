Bootstrapping Terraform Cloud (TFC) agents can be done in various ways. To maintain consistency in the process, I was leaning towards using HashiCorp's Auto-Config Management (ACM). However, the initial challenge lies in securely storing the GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) required for ACM. I'm aware that storing the token directly in a Git repository is not secure. I have been considering the approach of using a Docker image for ACM. With this approach, we can utilize init containers to securely retrieve the token from Vault.
