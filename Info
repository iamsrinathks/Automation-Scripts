I hope you are well.

I am currently setting up a custom domain for Google Cloud Workstations behind an internal Application Load Balancer (ALB). I have a couple of queries regarding the configuration and management of this setup that I need assistance with:

### 1. **Proxy-Only Subnet Allocation for Cloud Workstations**
As part of the planning process, I am allocating subnet ranges for the proxy-only subnet. Your documentation recommends using at least a /23 subnet (512 IP addresses). Could you please clarify the reasoning behind this recommendation?

I am specifically looking to understand:
- What factors contribute to the need for 512 IPs, and how would I calculate the required size for my specific use case?
- I plan to deploy around 2000 Cloud Workstations. How many proxies would be required to handle this number of workstations, and how do I accurately calculate the subnet range and the number of proxies needed to ensure smooth operation?

### 2. **Workstation Patching and Upgrades**
Could you also provide clarification regarding how VM upgrades or patches, which are managed by Google, impact running workstations?
- If a workstation is actively running during a patch or upgrade window, how will it be patched or upgraded?
- What is the expected impact on the running workstation, and is there a recommended approach to minimize downtime or disruption during these events?

Your guidance on these points will be greatly appreciated as I finalize my deployment plan.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to your response.
