The problem is that users need to access Cloud Workstations through a trusted, custom domain instead of the default `cloudworkstations.dev` domain. This requires setting up a private cluster with a Private Service Connect endpoint and configuring an Application Load Balancer with a custom SSL certificate, which adds complexity to the deployment and management of Cloud Workstations[1].

The motivation for implementing custom domains for Cloud Workstations is to enhance security and maintain brand consistency. By using a trusted, organization-specific domain, companies can ensure that their development environments align with their security policies and present a professional, cohesive image to both internal users and external collaborators.



## Option 1: Dedicated Load Balancer for Each Workstation Cluster

### Pros
1. **Isolation and Fault Tolerance**: Each cluster has its own load balancer, reducing the risk of a single point of failure affecting both clusters.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Load balancers can be fine-tuned for the specific needs of each cluster, potentially improving performance.
3. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Issues can be isolated to a specific cluster and its load balancer, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems.

### Cons
1. **Increased Cost**: Maintaining separate load balancers for each cluster will likely incur higher costs.
2. **Management Overhead**: More complex to manage and maintain multiple load balancers.
3. **Resource Utilization**: Potentially less efficient use of resources compared to a shared load balancer.

## Option 2: Shared Load Balancer for Both Clusters

### Pros
1. **Cost Efficiency**: A single load balancer reduces infrastructure costs.
2. **Simplified Management**: Easier to manage and maintain a single load balancer.
3. **Resource Optimization**: More efficient use of resources, as the load balancer can dynamically allocate traffic between clusters.

### Cons
1. **Single Point of Failure**: If the shared load balancer fails, both clusters will be affected.
2. **Complexity in Configuration**: More complex to configure and ensure that traffic is evenly and appropriately distributed between clusters.
3. **Potential Performance Bottlenecks**: A single load balancer might become a bottleneck if not properly scaled and managed.

## Recommendation

Given the scale of your deployment (4000 workstations), **Option 1: Dedicated Load Balancer for Each Workstation Cluster** is recommended. This approach provides better isolation and fault tolerance, which is crucial for maintaining high availability and performance in a large-scale environment. While it may incur higher costs and management overhead, the benefits of improved fault tolerance, performance optimization, and simplified troubleshooting outweigh these drawbacks. Ensuring that each cluster can operate independently will help mitigate risks and ensure a more resilient setup.
