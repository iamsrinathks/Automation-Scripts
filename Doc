The reason behind this request is that we require these permissions to effectively manage the creation, deletion, and updating of the GCP Cloud Workstation clusters and workstation configurations. While I acknowledge that this role was initially designated as read-only, the evolving needs of our data curation team necessitate these expanded permissions.

As part of our responsibilities, it is essential for us to have the capability to create and manage GCP Cloud Workstations entirely. This includes the setup and maintenance of associated configurations to ensure seamless workflow operations within our team.

Monitoring and Alerting in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Monitoring and alerting are critical aspects of managing and maintaining the health and performance of applications running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). GKE provides a robust set of tools and features for capturing various metrics and events, enabling real-time insights into the cluster and applications. This document aims to provide an overview of the key monitoring capabilities and best practices in GKE.

1. Monitoring Metrics in GKE

1.1 Cluster Level Components:
Virtual Machine (VM) Metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network I/O of the VM instances hosting the nodes.
1.2 Managed GKE Components:
Control Plane Metrics: Metrics related to the Kubernetes control plane, including API server latency, etcd metrics, scheduler metrics, etc.
1.3 Kubernetes Objects and Workloads:
Node Metrics: Metrics for individual Kubernetes nodes, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.
Pod Metrics: Metrics related to Kubernetes pods, including CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, etc.
Deployment Metrics: Metrics for Kubernetes deployments, such as the number of replicas, available replicas, etc.
ReplicaSet Metrics: Metrics for ReplicaSets, such as the desired number of replicas, current replicas, etc.
StatefulSet Metrics: Metrics for StatefulSets, including pod status, current replicas, desired replicas, etc.
DaemonSet Metrics: Metrics for DaemonSets, such as the number of scheduled pods, number of ready pods, etc.
Service Metrics: Metrics related to Kubernetes services, such as network traffic, request/response rates, etc.
1.4 Applications:
Custom Application Metrics: Metrics emitted by your applications, which you can capture using libraries like Prometheus, StatsD, or OpenTelemetry.
1.5 External to GKE:
External Service Metrics: Metrics from external services that your applications might depend on, such as databases, caches, or APIs.

2. Google Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver)

Google Cloud Monitoring, formerly known as Stackdriver, is a powerful tool that integrates seamlessly with GKE for monitoring and observability. It offers the following features:

Predefined Dashboards: GKE comes with predefined dashboards in Google Cloud Monitoring that provide an overview of the cluster health, node status, pod status, and other key metrics. These dashboards offer a quick glance at the overall performance of your cluster.
Autoscaling Metrics: GKE supports Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler. HPA scales the number of replicas of a deployment based on CPU utilization or custom metrics, and Cluster Autoscaler adjusts the size of your cluster based on resource demands. These autoscaling features rely on monitoring metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and custom metrics that you define.
Alerting Policies: Google Cloud Monitoring enables you to set up alerting policies based on specific conditions or thresholds. You can configure alerts to notify you via email, SMS, or other notification channels when certain metrics exceed defined thresholds. This helps you proactively respond to critical issues and avoid potential downtime.
Logging and Tracing Integration: Stackdriver also provides logging and tracing capabilities, allowing you to view logs from containers and system components in your cluster and trace requests across distributed systems.

3. Best Practices

Define Custom Metrics: Consider defining custom metrics specific to your application's performance and resource requirements. This allows you to gain deeper insights into application behavior and align monitoring with your application's needs.
Regularly Review and Fine-Tune: Regularly review your monitoring setup to ensure you capture meaningful insights and adjust alerting thresholds as needed. This practice helps you maintain a healthy and performant GKE cluster.
Use Service Mesh Metrics: If you utilize a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd, leverage the additional metrics related to traffic routing, service latency, and other networking aspects.
Optimize Node Pools: Monitor resource usage for different node pools to optimize resource allocation and identify any underutilized or overutilized nodes.
Conclusion

Effectively monitoring and alerting in GKE is essential for maintaining the reliability and performance of your applications. Leveraging Google Cloud Monitoring and understanding the available metrics empower you to respond proactively to potential issues, ensure smooth operations, and deliver a better user experience for your customers.

Please note that this document provides a high-level overview, and you may wish to expand on specific sections or tailor it to your organization's needs. Always refer to the official GKE documentation and best practices for the most up-to-date information on monitoring and alerting in GKE.
