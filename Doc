I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing with regards to the penalties I have incurred due to missing the Self Assessment deadlines for the tax years 2021/22 and 2022/23. Last Friday, 22nd June, I received my first written communication about this issue. Upon logging into my HMRC account, I realised that I had also missed the previous yearâ€™s deadline. I have not received any prior emails concerning these deadlines.

The oversight was unintentional and stemmed from my assumption that after switching from a Tier 2 ICT Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa in September 2022, I was no longer required to file a Self Assessment. This misunderstanding, coupled with significant personal events, contributed to my failure to submit the assessments on time. Last year, my wife gave birth to our child post due date on 31st January 2023, which understandably occupied my attention during that period.

I want to clarify that my only source of income is my main employment, and I do not have any secondary income from other sources.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request that you consider waiving the penalties imposed for the missed deadlines. The notification I received last Friday was the first written communication I received regarding this issue, and I acted promptly upon receiving it.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my request. Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to support my case.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
