I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing with regards to the penalties I have incurred due to missing the Self Assessment deadlines for the tax years 2021/22 and 2022/23. Last Friday, 22nd June, I received my first written communication about this issue. Upon logging into my HMRC account, I realised that I had also missed the previous yearâ€™s deadline. I have not received any prior emails concerning these deadlines.

The oversight was unintentional and stemmed from my assumption that after switching from a Tier 2 ICT Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa in September 2022, I was no longer required to file a Self Assessment. This misunderstanding, coupled with significant personal events, contributed to my failure to submit the assessments on time. Last year, my wife gave birth to our child post due date on 31st January 2023, which understandably occupied my attention during that period.

I want to clarify that my only source of income is my main employment, and I do not have any secondary income from other sources.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request that you consider waiving the penalties imposed for the missed deadlines. The notification I received last Friday was the first written communication I received regarding this issue, and I acted promptly upon receiving it.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my request. Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to support my case.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Sure, here's the draft for your email:

Subject: Request for Change: Update on OAuth Login Flow for GCP Cloud Workstations

Hi [Change Coordinator's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you about an upcoming change regarding the OAuth Login flow used by GCP Cloud Workstations and to request its inclusion in the upcoming SOE.

### Current Authentication Flow
Currently, the authentication process for users accessing GCP Cloud Workstations is as follows:
1. The user opens `80-{workstation-name}.cluster-{randomstring}.cloudworkstations.dev`.
2. The user gets redirected to `https://ssh.cloud.google.com/devshell/oauth?authuser=0&state={state-value}`.
3. If the user is authorized, they get redirected to `https://80-{workstation-name}.cluster-{randomstring}.cloudworkstations.dev/_workstation/login?redirect={state-value}&workstation_jwt={jwt-value}`.
4. The workstation then sets the `workstation_jwt` parameter's value as a cookie, and the user is logged in.

### Issue and Change
Our proxy has been blocking calls to `ssh.cloud.google.com`. We raised a feature request with Google, and they recently rolled out an update to address this issue.

### New Authentication Flow
The updated feature removes the redirection to `ssh.cloud.google.com`, simplifying the authentication process. We have validated this change in lower environments, and it works as expected. 

### Request
We would like to validate this update in the connected environment. Therefore, we request that you include this change as part of the SOE. This will involve deploying the workstation and attempting to launch it to ensure the new flow works correctly.

### Impact
This change should resolve the proxy issue and improve the authentication process for users without causing any disruptions or requiring additional modifications.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any concerns regarding this request.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

**Problem Statement:**

Evaluate the optimal design strategy for Application Load Balancer (ALB) deployment: Should we implement a shared ALB for all workstation clusters to streamline management and reduce costs, or deploy dedicated ALBs per cluster to enhance isolation, scalability, and performance? This decision is crucial for balancing operational efficiency against performance requirements and security considerations.

**Motivation:**

The design decision for Application Load Balancer (ALB) impacts our ability to efficiently manage resources and optimize performance. Choosing between a shared ALB for all clusters, which can reduce costs and simplify management, and dedicated ALBs per cluster, which can provide better isolation and scalability, is essential for aligning our infrastructure with organizational goals and operational requirements.
