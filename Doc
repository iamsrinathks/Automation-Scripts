I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing with regards to the penalties I have incurred due to missing the Self Assessment deadlines for the tax years 2021/22 and 2022/23. Last Friday, 22nd June, I received my first written communication about this issue. Upon logging into my HMRC account, I realised that I had also missed the previous yearâ€™s deadline. I have not received any prior emails concerning these deadlines.

The oversight was unintentional and stemmed from my assumption that after switching from a Tier 2 ICT Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa in September 2022, I was no longer required to file a Self Assessment. This misunderstanding, coupled with significant personal events, contributed to my failure to submit the assessments on time. Last year, my wife gave birth to our child post due date on 31st January 2023, which understandably occupied my attention during that period.

I want to clarify that my only source of income is my main employment, and I do not have any secondary income from other sources.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request that you consider waiving the penalties imposed for the missed deadlines. The notification I received last Friday was the first written communication I received regarding this issue, and I acted promptly upon receiving it.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my request. Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to support my case.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Sure, here's the draft for your email:

Subject: Request for Change: Update on OAuth Login Flow for GCP Cloud Workstations

Hi [Change Coordinator's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you about an upcoming change regarding the OAuth Login flow used by GCP Cloud Workstations and to request its inclusion in the upcoming SOE.

### Current Authentication Flow
Currently, the authentication process for users accessing GCP Cloud Workstations is as follows:
1. The user opens `80-{workstation-name}.cluster-{randomstring}.cloudworkstations.dev`.
2. The user gets redirected to `https://ssh.cloud.google.com/devshell/oauth?authuser=0&state={state-value}`.
3. If the user is authorized, they get redirected to `https://80-{workstation-name}.cluster-{randomstring}.cloudworkstations.dev/_workstation/login?redirect={state-value}&workstation_jwt={jwt-value}`.
4. The workstation then sets the `workstation_jwt` parameter's value as a cookie, and the user is logged in.

### Issue and Change
Our proxy has been blocking calls to `ssh.cloud.google.com`. We raised a feature request with Google, and they recently rolled out an update to address this issue.

### New Authentication Flow
The updated feature removes the redirection to `ssh.cloud.google.com`, simplifying the authentication process. We have validated this change in lower environments, and it works as expected. 

### Request
We would like to validate this update in the connected environment. Therefore, we request that you include this change as part of the SOE. This will involve deploying the workstation and attempting to launch it to ensure the new flow works correctly.

### Impact
This change should resolve the proxy issue and improve the authentication process for users without causing any disruptions or requiring additional modifications.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any concerns regarding this request.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

### Architecture Decision for Federated Workstation Clusters

#### Overview
The proposed architecture involves:
1. Federated workstation clusters managed by the business team.
2. Federated workstation clusters managed by the platform team.
3. A centrally managed single cluster by the platform team.

#### Pros and Cons

#### Federated Workstation Clusters Managed by Business Team

**Pros:**
- **Autonomy**: Business teams have control over their clusters, allowing for tailored configurations and quicker response times to specific needs[5].
- **Specialization**: Clusters can be optimized for the specific applications and workloads of the business unit, improving performance and efficiency[2].
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale individual clusters independently based on the business unit's requirements without affecting other clusters[1].

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: Increased complexity in managing multiple clusters, especially in terms of security, updates, and compliance[2].
- **Resource Duplication**: Potential for resource duplication and inefficiencies, as each business unit might replicate similar infrastructure[5].
- **Inter-Cluster Communication**: Challenges in ensuring seamless communication and data sharing between clusters managed by different business units[5].

#### Federated Workstation Clusters Managed by Platform Team

**Pros:**
- **Centralized Expertise**: Platform team can leverage specialized knowledge to manage clusters more effectively and ensure best practices are followed[5].
- **Consistency**: Uniform management practices across clusters, ensuring consistency in security, updates, and compliance[2].
- **Resource Optimization**: Better resource utilization and optimization across clusters, reducing redundancy and costs[1].

**Cons:**
- **Bottlenecks**: Potential for bottlenecks if the platform team becomes overwhelmed with managing multiple clusters[2].
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Less flexibility for individual business units to quickly adapt clusters to their specific needs[5].
- **Dependency**: Business units become dependent on the platform team for changes and updates, which could slow down response times[5].

#### Centrally Managed Single Cluster by Platform Team

**Pros:**
- **Simplified Management**: Easier to manage a single cluster, reducing administrative overhead and complexity[2].
- **Cost Efficiency**: Potential for cost savings through centralized resource allocation and reduced duplication[1].
- **Enhanced Security**: Easier to implement and maintain robust security measures across a single cluster[2].

**Cons:**
- **Single Point of Failure**: Risk of a single point of failure, which could impact all business units if the cluster experiences issues[2].
- **Scalability Issues**: May face scalability challenges as the needs of different business units grow and diverge[5].
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Potential for performance bottlenecks if the cluster is not adequately sized or optimized for diverse workloads[5].

### Conclusion
The decision to implement federated workstation clusters managed by both business and platform teams, alongside a centrally managed single cluster, offers a balance between autonomy and centralized control. This hybrid approach can leverage the strengths of both models while mitigating their respective weaknesses. However, careful planning and robust management practices are essential to address the complexities and potential challenges of such an architecture.
